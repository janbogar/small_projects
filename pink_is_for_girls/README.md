### Pink is for girls
This is a code that generated plots for this [page](https://janbogar.github.io/ruzova-je-pre-baby/) on my blog.
It downloads images of clothes from outdoor shops and creates separate color histograms for men and women clothes to find out what are the differences in available collor palete based on gender.


Recognition of background is based on this [code](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-April/006220.html) of floodfill algorithm with treshold.

**WARNING**

Crawler is not included to protect shops from excessive scraping, so the code won't work out of the box.
